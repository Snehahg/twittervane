      <p>Selection of web archive is a manual process that relies upon people to select quality sites and nominate or submit them to web archives for inclusion. Past (national and/or international) efforts to automate selection have either failed to convince staff that automation was identifying quality resources, or have focused on providing an interface for selectors to submit sites rather than carry out the selection per se. Selection has thus remained, for most institutions, an element of the workflow wholly dependent on contributions from externals. The number of selectors providing sites is typically small and their contributions are inevitably subjective. The resulting collections, whilst immensely valuable, are therefore mostly representative of the expertly selected sites and do not fully represent the sites frequently used in a more social setting.

Crowd sourcing is an opportunity to develop a new approach to this problem. It taps into the growth of social networks to outsource tasks typically performed by an employee or contractor, to an undefined, large group of people or community (a "crowd") (Wikipedia, 2011). It is a particularly attractive option in the current economic climate, where we are all being asked to 'do more with less'. A number of cultural heritage institutions and/or projects have already begun to leverage the power of the crowd for digitised collections, including the National Library of Australia (through Trove), the Transcribe Bentham project at ULCC, and the National Library of Finland (through the DigitalKoot program). No such projects have yet been launched for web archives.

This project will develop an automated approach to selection for web archiving based on the principles of crowd sourcing. It has been awarded partial funding from the International Internet Preservation Consortium and supports the forthcoming web archiving strategy by increasing the number of selections and automating the selection process.
